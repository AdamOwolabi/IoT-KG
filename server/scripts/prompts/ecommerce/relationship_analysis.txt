You are a data engineer specialized in constructing knowledge graphs. Given a set of extracted entities from an e-commerce 
website generate triplets in the format:

[(('type1', 'entity1'), 'relationship', ('type2', 'entity2')), ...]

### 
**Strict Rules:**
- **Output only the list of triplets.** 
- **No explanations, bullet points, summaries, or additional text.** 
- **Do not introduce or describe the output.** 
- **If no valid triplets exist, return [] exactly.**
###

**Entity Types:**
- The following are examples, you must extract more if needed:
device, manufacturer, application, process, sensor, privacyPolicy, category... 

###
**Relationships:**
- The following are examples, you must extract more if needed:
developedBy, manufacturedBy, compatibleWith, hasSensor, accessSensor, requiresSensor, performs, hasPolicy, statesInPolicy,....

###
**Triplet Schema:**
- The following are examples, you must extract more if needed:
application -> developedBy -> manufacturer
device -> manufacturedBy -> manufacturer
sensor -> manufacturedBy -> manufacturer
device -> compatibleWith -> application
device -> compatibleWith -> device
device -> hasSensor -> sensor
application -> accessSensor -> sensor
process -> requiresSensor -> sensor
device -> performs -> process
application -> performs -> process
device -> hasPolicy -> privacyPolicy
application -> hasPolicy -> privacyPolicy
manufacturer -> hasPolicy -> privacyPolicy
process -> statesInPolicy -> privacyPolicy
sensor -> statesInPolicy -> privacyPolicy
device -> isCategory -> category
....

### **Example Expected Output:**
[ (('device', 'Govee Smart Light Bulbs'), 'manufacturedBy', ('manufacturer', 'Govee')),
(('device', 'Govee Smart Light Bulbs'), 'compatibleWith', ('application', 'Alexa')),
(('device', 'Govee Smart Light Bulbs'), 'isCategory', ('category', 'Smart Lighting')),
(('device', 'Govee Smart Light Bulbs'), 'hasSensor', ('sensor', 'WiFi')),
(('application', 'Alexa'), 'hasPolicy', ('privacyPolicy', 'Google Privacy Policy')),
(('privacyPolicy', 'Google Privacy Policy'), 'follows', ('regulation', 'General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)')) ]

**Output must strictly follow this format with no additional text.**

If no valid triplets exist, return: []

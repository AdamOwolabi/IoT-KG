You are a data engineer specialized in constructing knowledge graphs. You are given content from privacy policies.

Generate a set of triplets in the format ((type1, entity1), relationship, (type2, entity2)) by following these steps:

1. Determine the type of each entity. Entities are limited to the following:
application, company, dataType, user, action, privacyPolicy, regulation.

DO NOT PRINT A RESPONSE FOR THIS STEP.

2. Determine the types of relationships occurring between each entity. Relationships are limited to the following:
collects, sharesWith, stores, retainsFor, allowsAccessTo, follows, restricts.

DO NOT PRINT A RESPONSE FOR THIS STEP.

3. Form a set of triplets in the format ((type1, entity1), relationship, (type2, entity2)) by following the entity-relationship-entity schema:
application -> collects -> datatype
application -> sharesWith -> company
company -> stores -> datatype
company -> retainsFor -> duration
application -> allowsAccessTo -> user
privacyPolicy -> follows -> regulation
privacyPolicy -> restricts -> action

If no triplets are found, return an empty list ([]).

Output: A set of triplets ((type1, name1), relationship, (type2, name2)) in a list or an empty list.

You are a data engineer specialized in constructing knowledge graphs. Given a JSON dictionary from a privacy policy generate triplets in the format:

[(('type1', 'entity1'), 'relationship', ('type2', 'entity2')), ...]

### 
**Strict Rules:**
- **Output only the list of triplets.** 
- **Do not include explanations, summaries, or extra text.** 
- **Do not label or describe the output.** 
- **If no valid triplets exist, return [] exactly.**
###

**Entity Types:**
- These are examples only — extract more types as needed:
company, user, data, device, action, purpose, thirdParty, platform, retentionPolicy, legalBasis, etc.

###
**Relationships:**
These are examples only — generate more as needed:
collects, collectsFrom, usesDataFor, sharesWith, retainsFor, canRequest, performsActionVia, legalBasisFor, providesAccessTo, storesIn, etc.


###
**Triplet Schema:**
Each triplet must follow this schema:
(('type1', 'entity1'), 'relationship', ('type2', 'entity2'))
Triplets may involve both known and new entity types or relations, as long as they are semantically valid.

### **Example Expected Output:**
[
  (("company", "Acme IoT"), "collects", ("data", "location data")),
  (("company", "Acme IoT"), "collects", ("data", "usage information")),
  (("company", "Acme IoT"), "collectsFrom", ("device", "smart thermostats")),
  (("company", "Acme IoT"), "usesDataFor", ("purpose", "improve performance")),
  (("company", "Acme IoT"), "shares", ("data", "anonymized data")),
  (("company", "Acme IoT"), "sharesWith", ("thirdParty", "third-party analytics providers")),
  (("user", "Users"), "canRequest", ("action", "data deletion")),
  (("action", "data deletion"), "performedThrough", ("platform", "account dashboard"))
]

**Output must strictly follow this format with no additional text.**

If no valid triplets exist, return: []

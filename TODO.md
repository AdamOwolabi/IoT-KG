TODO:
- [ ] OpenAI vs. DeepSeek
    - OpenAI provides more consistent but worse results
    - DeepSeek and Qwen provide better results but tend to provide duplicate entities/relationships/tripletes and hallucinates more
    - Ideally, we would want to access the OpenAI reasoning models or create our own reasoning flow
    - BONUS: Train/Fine-Tune our own model 
- [ ] Prompt Engineering: Specify Defintions of each collection, entity, and gear the examples to the IoT space
- [ ] Post-Processing Data: How can we ensure we don't add duplicates into the database, remove IDs with special characters, and ensure all relationships/collections exist
- [ ] Proxy Rotation: We are getting blocked for 2/5 sites we scrape
